Piece: "Charles"

This project poses one big question to the viewer. How can we really be sure that this reality, and our perception of it, truly is meaningful at all? In other words, what actually differentiates our experience and our perception of the world from Charles's? 

Charles follows the most basic rules of conversational flow, albeit roughly, by talking when you finish talking. He does not, however, even attempt to understand what you are saying, and tends to dominate the conversation with his own robotic ramblings. At times, he even playfully calls attention to the obvious disconnect in the dialogue, stating "This conversation feels a bit one-sided, don't you think?" and "Sorry. I feel like my head is full of fluff today." which of course, it is.

And yet despite his brusque and mechanical nature, it is difficult not to personify Charles. He has a name, a face, a charming British accent, and a personality, despite only knowing how to say 15 different things. Clearly a simpleton, but at times, it isn't hard to imagine what type of person Charles might be, if given the computational bandwidth and exceptional equipment we humans have. 

We look at Charles, and with our impressive brains, sensory organs, complex networks of neurons and organic computational machinery, could hardly imagine living such a limited life. Yet on our own scale, are we really so far removed from a microphone, a speaker, and a simple computational device directing the symphony?
