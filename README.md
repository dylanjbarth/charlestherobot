I created Charles over the course of three weeks for my final project in Vis147a during Fall Quarter of 2012 at UCSD. I detailed my progress fairly thoroughly on [a blog](dylanhacks.wordpress.com) and you're more than welcome to get in touch with me if you're curious about anything I did via [my own website](http://www.dylanbarth.com).
