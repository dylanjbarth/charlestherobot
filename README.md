# Charles

## a simple chatbot created with an Arduino, WaveShield, elecret microphone, speaker, and lots of love

I created Charles over the course of three weeks for my final project in Vis147a during Fall Quarter of 2012 at UCSD. I detailed my progress fairly thoroughly at dylanhacks.wordpress.com and you're more than welcome to get in touch with me if you're curious about anything I did.
