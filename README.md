Charles
=======
a simple chatbot 
----------------

I created Charles over the course of three weeks for my final project in Vis147a during Fall Quarter of 2012 at UCSD. I detailed my progress fairly thoroughly on [a blog](dylanhacks.wordpress.com). If you are doing an Arduino project that involves anything to do with audio, some of the resources I link to in my posts might be helpful to you. This project involved the use of the [AdaFruit Wave Shield](http://adafruit.com/products/94) and the [elecret microphone with breakout board from SparkFun)[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9964]. 

Also, you're more than welcome to get in touch with me if you'd like via [my page](http://www.dylanbarth.com).
